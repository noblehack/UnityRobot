HOW TO PLAY: There are 6 car parts spread accross the map in various structures. 
The red bar is your health, the green is flashlight battery, and the blue is stamina.
While exploring robot dogs chase you, but while inside of a structure, the dogs stop and return to home.
Make sure to note the numbers seen on the various structures.
The only way to exit and win is to collect all car parts, remember the numbers, and to take the elevator by the giant exit sign

Controls -
E is interact (Works on doors, car parts, medkits, and the green elevator platform)
C is how to use a medkit after picking them up
F is used for a temporary extremely bright flashlight
Stand on the charger platforms to charge flashligh battery

Also drive extremely slow in the car because theres no safety net to keep you from plunging into the void because i havent fixed that yet lol
